This vignette for the [unpivotr](https://github.com/nacnudus/unpivotr) package
demonstrates unpivoting multiple similar tables from a spreadsheet via the
[tidyxl](https://github.com/nacnudus/tidyxl) package.  It is best read with the
spreadsheet open in a spreadsheet program, e.g. Excel, LibreOffice Calc or
Gnumeric.

## Introduction

The spreadsheet is from the famous Enron subpoena, made available by [Felienne
Hermans](http://www.felienne.com/archives/3634), and has has previously been
publicised by Jenny Bryan and David Robinson, in particular in Robinson's
article ['Tidying an untidyable
dataset'](https://rpubs.com/dgrtwo/tidying-enron).

Here's a screenshot:

## Preparation

This vignette uses several common packages.

```{r}
library(unpivotr)
library(tidyxl)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(purrr)
library(stringr)
```

The spreadsheet is distributed with the unpivotr package, so can be loaded as a
system file.

```{r}
path <- system.file("extdata/enron.xlsx",
                    package = "unpivotr")
```

## Main

### Importing the data

Spreadsheet cells are imported with the `tidy_xlsx()` function.  By default, this
returns all the sheets in the spreadsheet, as elements in a list, wrapped in
another list of two elements: data and formats.  Since there is only one sheet
in this file, the data list has length 1, but it is still a list for the sake of
consistency.  Hence the sheet is accessed with the list
subsetter `[[1]]`.

```{r}
cells <- tidy_xlsx(path)$data[[1]]
```

Cell formatting isn't required for this vignette, but if it were, it would be
imported via `tidy_xlsx(path)$formats`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
formatting <- tidy_xlsx(path)$formats
```

### Importing one of the multiples

The small multiples each have exactly one 'Fixed Price' header, so begin by
selecting one of those.

```{r}
fixed_price <- filter(cells, character == "Fixed Price")[1, ]
```

From that single cell, selct the three rows of the column headers of the first
small multiple.  The `split()` function below separates each row from one
another, wrapping them together in a list.  They are separated so that they can
individually be joined to the data cells later.  Another way to do this is to
select each row one by one, assigning them to different variables.

```{r}
col_headers <-
  fixed_price %>%
  offset_N(cells, n = 1) %>%    # Offset up one row to "IF NWPL Rocky Mountains"
  extend_E(cells, 3) %>%        # Extend to the right edge of the table
  extend_S(cells, 2) %>%        # Extend down to the third row of the headers
  filter(!is.na(content)) %>%   # Remove blanks
  select(row, col, value = character) %>% # Prepare for joining to data cells
  split(.$row)                  # Separate the row of headers into list elements
col_headers
```

Now select the data cells, starting from the 'Fixed Price' header again.

```{r}
datacells <-
  fixed_price %>%
  offset_S(cells, n = 2) %>%
  extend_E(cells, 4) %>%
  extend_S(cells,                       # Extend down to a blank row
           boundary = ~ is.na(content), # The formula detects blank cells
           edge = TRUE) %>%          # Require the whole row to be blank
  filter(!is.na(content)) %>%           # Remove remaining blanks
  mutate(value = as.double(content)) %>%# Convert the values to double
  select(row, col, value)               # Prepare for joining to headers
print(datacells, n = Inf)
```

Finally, bind the data cells to the column headers (this is the real magic).
For more examples of how the compass directions work (the `NNW()` and `N()`
functions below), see the vignette called `Compass Directions`.

```{r}
datacells %>%
  NNW(col_headers[[1]]) %>% # This header isn't in every column
  NNW(col_headers[[2]]) %>%  # Nor is this header
  N(col_headers[[3]])    # But this one is
```

### Importing every small multiple at once

The code above, for a single multiple, can easily be adapted to import every one
of the small multiples.  Here this is done using the
[`purrr()`](https://github.com/hadley/purrr) package to apply the code to each
element of a list of 'Fixed Price' header cells.

Get all ten 'Fixed Price' headers, and separate each into its own list element.
Since each cell has a unique combination of `row` and `col`, that combination
can be used to separate the cells into list elements.

```{r}
fixed_price <-
  cells %>%
  filter(character == "Fixed Price") %>%
  split(paste(.$row, .$col))
```

Adapt the code for a single multiple a 'tidy' function to tidy a general small
multiple, starting from the 'Fixed Price' header.  Here this is done by
substituting `x` for `fixed_price`, and wrapping the three sections of code in a
function.  Everything else is the same.

```{r}
tidy <- function(x) {
  col_headers <-
    x %>%
    offset_N(cells, n = 1) %>%
    extend_E(cells, 3) %>%
    extend_S(cells, 2) %>%
    filter(!is.na(content)) %>%
    select(row, col, value = character) %>%
    split(.$row)
  datacells <-
    x %>%
    offset_S(cells, n = 2) %>%
    extend_E(cells, 4) %>%
    extend_S(cells,
             boundary = ~ is.na(content),
             edge = TRUE) %>%
    filter(!is.na(content)) %>%
    mutate(value = as.double(content)) %>%
    select(row, col, value)
  datacells %>%
    NNW(col_headers[[1]]) %>%
    NNW(col_headers[[2]]) %>%
    N(col_headers[[3]])
}
```

Finally, map the 'tidy' function to each 'Fixed Price' header, and bind the
results.  into one data frame.  The [`purrr()`](https://github.com/hadley/purrr)
package
is used here, but this could also be done with the `apply()` family of
functions.

```{r}
map_df(fixed_price, tidy) %>%
  arrange(col, row) # See that, from row 39, the region changes, as it ought.
```

### Joining the row headers

So far, only the column headers have been joined, but there are also row headers
on the left-hand side of the spreadsheet.  The following code incorporates these
into the final dataset.

```{r}
row_headers <-
  cells %>%
  filter(character == "Cash") %>%
  split(paste(.$row, .$col))

row_headers <-
  map_df(row_headers,
    ~ .x %>%
      extend_S(cells, boundary = ~ is.na(content)) %>%
      extend_E(cells, boundary = ~ is.na(content), edge = TRUE) %>%
      filter(!is.na(content)) %>%
      # This concatenates the "Dec-20 to Mar-20" cells into one column.
      # First it converts Excel dates, via R dates, into text.
      mutate(character = ifelse(!is.na(character),
                                character,
                                format(as.POSIXct(as.integer(content) * (60*60*24),
                                       origin="1899-12-30",
                                       tz="GMT"), "%b-%C"))) %>%
      # Then it concatentates them by row.
      select(row, col, character) %>%
      spread(col, character, fill = "") %>%
      mutate(col = 1, value = str_trim(paste(`2`, `3`, `4`))) %>%
      select(row, col, value))
```

Since the single column of row headers applies to every row of every small
multiple (unlike the column headers), a global `row_headers` variable can be
joined to each small multiple by using a simple W() join. This is incorporated
into the definition of `tidy()` below (see the bottom line).

```{r}
tidy <- function(x) {
  col_headers <-
    x %>%
    offset_N(cells, n = 1) %>%
    extend_E(cells, 3) %>%
    extend_S(cells, 2) %>%
    filter(!is.na(content)) %>%
    select(row, col, value = character) %>%
    split(.$row)
  datacells <-
    x %>%
    offset_S(cells, n = 2) %>%
    extend_E(cells, 4) %>%
    extend_S(cells,
             boundary = ~ is.na(content),
             edge = TRUE) %>%
    filter(!is.na(content)) %>%
    mutate(value = as.double(content)) %>%
    select(row, col, value)
  datacells %>%
    NNW(col_headers[[1]]) %>%
    NNW(col_headers[[2]]) %>%
    N(col_headers[[3]]) %>%
    W(row_headers) # This is the only new line
}

map_df(fixed_price, tidy) %>%
  arrange(col, row) # See that, from row 39, the context loops, as it ought.
```
